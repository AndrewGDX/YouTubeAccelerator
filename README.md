# YouTube Accelerator

Accelerate YouTube videos up to 8x speed!

There is no UI, only keyboard shortcuts. Use '<' and '>' buttons (without shift) to speed up or speed down the video, and press 'R' to reset to the default speed. You can change hotkeys in settings. YouTube Shorts acceleration is working as well.

The plugin does not collect any statistics or personal data, feel free to use!
